# FF4J
FF4J is a hobby JVM implementation. Its main purpose is to help me better myself as a developer (and entertain me).

## What FF4J Is
 - A toy project
 - Kinda neat

## What FF4J Isn't
 - "Production Ready"
 - Secure
 - Performant
 - Feature-Complete
 - Specification-Compliant
 
 ## Odin?
[Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) is a relatively young systems programming language. I'm using Odin, frankly, because it's actually enjoyable to use, compared to things like C/C++. Besides that, I just think it's better than C/C++. #FiteMe

(Also Jai hasn't been released yet... (no offense Odin, I **love** you :joy:))
